## Making a plan
1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
<h3>did it on paper</h3>
2) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision
<h3>named</h3>
3) For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?
<h3>done</h3>
4) Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
<h3>done</h3>
5) Is there some state we need to initialize?
<h3>computer selection</h3>
<h3>win</h3>
<h3>lose</h3>
<h3>draw</h3>
6) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?
7) Think about how to validate each of your steps
8) Consider your data model. What objects will you be using? What are the key/value pairs? What arrays do you need? What needs to live in local storage?
9) Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.

<!-- Page layout (title, header, footer?, etc.) -->
<!-- Explain the rules (paper beats rock, rock beats scissors, scissors beats papers), an HTML List might be a good semantic choice. -->
<!-- Radio buttons with same name for grouping for choosing rock, paper, or scissors (images anyone?) -->
<!-- Button for "Play" -->
<!-- Display of wins and losses and draws -->
<!-- Display of result of each game (can be text and/or images), should indicate what the computer threw and what the result was (win, loss, draw) -->
